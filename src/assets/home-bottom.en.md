# Stopping Transphobic Violence

The [Transgender Factsheet](https://www.unfe.org/en/know-the-facts/challenges-solutions/transgender) from the UN Human Rights Office states that “Trans people in all parts of the world are at heightened risk of violence, harassment and discrimination.
Human rights violations range from bullying and verbal abuse, to denial of healthcare, education, work and housing, to criminalization, arbitrary arrest and detention, violence, assault, torture, rape and murder.
Exposure to these and related abuses may be further exacerbated by other factors, such as age, ethnicity, occupation, socio-economic class and disability."  

In addition to advocating for a better social environment, there are many things that an individual can do:

- Understand the issues and concerns of transgender individuals' life experiences.  
- Address them with their preferred pronouns, genders, and names.  
- Take the initiative to say no when you witness any form of stigma, discrimination, and violence against transgender people.
